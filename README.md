### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/).
My research interests include software and system security, program analysis, and I know a little about machine learning.
I am currently working on developing techniques to detect and mitigate security vulnerabilities in software systems.

I am a big fan of open-source software and I love to contribute to projects that I use.
