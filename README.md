### Hi there 👋

I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/).
My research focuses on program translation and software security, with an emphasis on machine learning for code. I am currently developing techniques for verified C-to-Rust translation and analyzing the security implications of AI-generated code.

I am a big fan of open-source software and I love to contribute to projects that I use.
